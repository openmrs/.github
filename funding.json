We find this small team makes a big difference in inspiring, coordinating, and up-skilling our global network, so that we can be an ever-more-sustainable community. We provide critical support to members through community management, event planning, communications, developer mentorship, architectural leadership, complex code reviews, and program management. We onboard new members, help organization members collaborate together, and raise the visibility of our community’s achievements. Our technical support members help contributors to develop their skill sets through peer coaching, support hours, academy content, and virtual or in-person hackathons. This model also has an extremely cost effective ROI: We estimate our cost per year per beneficiary is $0.04 USD (4 cents) for the central OpenMRS software and community stewardship.",

To make the experience more meaningful, we aim to pair each fellow with a Fellow Mentor and an active squad or project. Most fellowship opportunities are 6-9 months long. Many of our successful Fellowship Graduates are recruited by Community Organizations, where they become key ongoing contributors embedding OpenMRS’ knowledge and values in their home organization. This program’s popularity generally exceeds the stipend funding available, but it has been an important mechanism for helping junior talent grow into the next stage in their career. One junior Fellowship for 6-months is $10,000 USD; one more senior Fellowship for 6-months is around $25,000 USD.
